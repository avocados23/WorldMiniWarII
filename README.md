# AP Computer Science AB Final Project, 2017-18

My junior year project for AP Computer Science Level AB in high school (2018). Thanks to Jack Kelly for the genetic programming algorithm utilized in my game in determining the better team between the two players of the game.

## Prerequisites

```
Requires Java and JavaFX to run the game fully. 
```

The game is unfinished, and I leave to anyone who is interested in adding features to the game and perhaps providing an ending to it all to feel free.

### Notes

The genetic programming algorithm can be in the console of the game, determining the outcome of your troops over time.
